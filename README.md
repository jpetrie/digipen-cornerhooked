# Corner Hooked

Corner Hooked is a pool game played within a water-filled volume rather than on the surface of a table. It was
created in 2004 by the Scientific Ninja team as part of our GAM300 and GAM350 project courses at
[DigiPen Institute of Technology](https://digipen.edu).

The game was written in C++ using Direct3D for the graphics. Visual Studio was our IDE. The AI made use of a trained
neural network as well as a rules engine to guide the higher-level strategic play for a given game type (8-ball versus
9-ball, for example).

This repository is a mostly-complete copy of the final source code submission we turned in for the course. FMOD headers
and binaries have been removed, as have the actual audio assets for the game. The trained neural network is included
(`AIPlayer.bpn`), and the code that performs the training still exists, although the scripts we used to perform the
training and the initial inputs have been lost.

The members of the Scientific Nina team who created the game were:
 - Brian Rosmond
 - James Scott Lancaster
 - James Carnahan
 - Josh Petrie
 - Scott Smith
